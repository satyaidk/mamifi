# 🎈 Bubble Tap - A Monad-Powered On-Chain Game

Bubble Tap is a fun, fast-paced tapping game built on the Monad Blockchain, where **every interaction is an on-chain transaction**. Players tap on floating bubbles to increase their score — but beware of the bombs! Tapping a bomb deducts points and might cost you your leaderboard rank.

This game showcases the **high throughput and low-latency capabilities of Monad**, making it the perfect playground for on-chain gaming.

## 🚀 Why Monad?

We built Bubble Tap on [Monad](https://monad.xyz) to leverage:

- ⚡ **10,000+ TPS** & **300M gas/sec**: Ultra-fast processing for real-time games  
- 🧠 **EVM Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing EVM-based tooling  
- 🕐 **1s Block Time with Single-Slot Finality**: Game moves as fast as you do  
- 💸 **Gas Efficiency**: Minimal cost per interaction, even at scale  
- 📈 **Gas Spike Resistance**: No slowdowns during peak activity

On Monad, every tap, bubble pop, or bomb click is recorded immutably on-chain — no cheating, no rewinds, just pure skill and reflexes.

- Tap 💣 **Bombs** → Lose Points  
- Every tap = one transaction on Monad  
- Scores are public, transparent, and stored on-chain  
- Compete on a **global leaderboard** updated in real-time
